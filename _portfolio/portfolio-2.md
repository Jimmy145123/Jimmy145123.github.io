As the team leader of the 'Sky Guardians', our topic was selected as finalist for [KOREN Net Challenge Season 11](https://www.koren.kr/kor/Alram/contyPass.asp?cd=34&page=1). I anticipated the future commercialization of drones for services like drone delivery and drone taxis, and developed a drone control system to ensure safe flight operations. Utilizing the KOREN network and Virtual Machines, we enabled communication between drones and a central server. 
I personally wrote the collision avoidance code, which calculates potential collision risks in advance and adjusts departure times accordingly. Click [here](/files/최종발표자료_스카이가디언즈.pdf) to view materials.
