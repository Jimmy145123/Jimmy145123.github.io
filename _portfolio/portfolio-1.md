As the team leader of the 'Creative Ohgamja', I led our team to win an award in the [2023 Yonsei-Nexon Creative Platform](https://yicrc.yonsei.ac.kr/main/creative.asp?mid=m04_03). Our project focused on developing a movie screening system that allows the hearing impaired to watch movies with non-disabled individuals. By utilizing two beam projectors and polarized films, hearing-impaired viewers wearing glasses with polarized filters could see barrier-free subtitles, while non-disabled viewers could watch the movie as usual. I contributed by suggesting ideas and creating the actual model during the competition.<br/><img src='/images/4.우수_크리에이티브 오감자.png'>
