### Club Activity

<div align="justify">
As a member of the CREAT+IT, I studied how to use the OpenAI API and uploaded what I learned to the Notion page each week. Through these activities, I was able to learn how to effectively utilize the API. ALso, as a member of the team 'DIVU' within the club, I developed an app that uses ChatGPT to provide users with information related to their neighborhood based on their location. As a team member, I helped build the regional information database and participated in the app development. <br/><br/><img src='/images/creatit.png'>
