I'm undergraduate student in Yonsei University, Dept. of Artificial Intelligence. As a sophomore student, I have studied 'Discrete Structure', 'Data Structure', 'Object Oriented Programming', 'Linear Algebra', 'Probability and Statics', and currently studying basic Mathematics and Theory for Deep Learning. Also I am participating in various school clubs and competitions to experience many fields related to my major. Please visit `Activity' and `Project' for more related contents.<br/><br/>
My research interests lie in artificial intelligence and aviation. I am very interested in airplanes. Airplanes incorporate a wide variety of algorithms, including autopilot systems, and there has been active development of artificial intelligence for aviation systems in recent years. Therefore, I am particularly interested in the development of related artificial intelligence. To prepare for my research, I am studying various engineering subjects, including engineering mathematics, and I am also diligently studying artificial intelligence.
